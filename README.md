This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

1. immutable 库
 immutable对象 用来解决什么问题的，如果没有这个库，自己怎么解决这个问题
 防止在业务里直接修改 store state, im mutable 不可改变 不可更改


在使用的时候就需要使用 get, 更新数据的时候使用set更新，它不会直接更改state, immutable对象的set方法，会结合之前immutable对象的值和设置的值，返回一个全新的对象

2. redux-immutable 模块
为什么要有这个模块，解决什么问题，有点和缺点 

```
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    focused: state.header.get('focused')
});
```

> state是一个js对象，state.header是一个immutable对象，我们系统统一成immutable对象。我们希望state也成为一个immutable 

3. combineReducers 在redux和redux-immutable都有
有什么区别，为什么从新封装了，却不更改名字？
